    "## deque Recipes\n",
    "\n",
    "This section shows various approaches to working with deques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bounded length deques provide functionality similar to the tail filter in Unix:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def tail(filename, n=10):\n",
    "    'Return the last n lines of a file'\n",
    "    return deque(open(filename), n)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Another approach to using deques is to maintain a sequence of recently added elements by appending to the right and popping to the left:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def moving_average(iterable, n=3):\n",
    "    # moving_average([40, 30, 50, 46, 39, 44]) --> 40.0 42.0 45.0 43.0\n",
    "    # http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average\n",
    "    it = iter(iterable)\n",
    "    d = deque(itertools.islice(it, n-1))\n",
    "    d.appendleft(0)\n",
    "    s = sum(d)\n",
    "    for elem in it:\n",
    "        s += elem - d.popleft()\n",
    "        d.append(elem)\n",
    "        yield s / float(n)\n",
    "```\n",
    "The **rotate()** method provides a way to implement deque slicing and deletion. For example, a pure Python implementation of del d[n] relies on the **rotate()** method to position elements to be popped:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def delete_nth(d, n):\n",
    "    d.rotate(-n)\n",
    "    d.popleft()\n",
    "    d.rotate(n)\n",
    "```\n",
    "To implement deque slicing, use a similar approach applying rotate() to bring a target element to the left side of the deque. Remove old entries with popleft(), add new entries with extend(), and then reverse the rotation. With minor variations on that approach, it is easy to implement Forth style stack manipulations such as dup, drop, swap, over, pick, rot, and roll.\n",
